displayed on the graph.
You can switch the display on/off with the
button, and change the function name.

You can also solve differential equations
approximatively. The searched
function is displayed on the graph
It should have the form "y' = f(y, t) & y(t_0) = y_0"

Input:
* min(f) / max(f)
* f(x) = 0
* f'(x) / df(x)/dx
* f^n(a) / d^nf(a)/dx^n
* int(a, b, f(x))
* neville((x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...,(xn, yn))
