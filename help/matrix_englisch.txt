Help for Matrixframe:


    T()
transposition

    inverse()
Specifies what the inverse matrix is using the operations from the Gaussian method.

    det()
Using the Gaussian operations, this function determines the determinant.

    eigenvalues()
Calculates eigenvalues

    power_method()
Only for real diagonalizable matrix (large restriction): With power method the largest eigenvalue is determined.


    Decompositions:

    lu()
Decomposition of a matrix with regular principal minors A = L*U with L normalized lower-triangular matrix and U upper-triangulear matrix

    QR()
Any matrix (not necessarily square) can be decomposed as A=QR with Q orthogonal matrix and R extended triangular matrix.

    cholesky()
Decomposes a symmetric positive definite matrix A = L * L^T, i.e. a stable version of the LU decomposition, with half the effort.


    Solve systems of linear equations:

    LU
Solves LUx=b by solving Ly=b and then Ux=y.

    Cholesky
Analogous to LU

    Gauss
Elementary row transformations are used to transform A to the Id matrix. These operations are applied to b to solve Ax=b

    balancing_problem (automatic selection when rows > columns)
Given an overdetermined and unsolvable problem Ax=b, this method finds a solution that best solves the equations (it minimizes the squares of the errors). Useful for interpolation and physics.
